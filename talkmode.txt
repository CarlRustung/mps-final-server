The reader reads a selected line.

To get a line to read, you need the CURRENT line ID and the responseType.


The listener selects the responseType. This also determines the NEXT line ID.

On end of turn:

the reader becomes the listener. The response buttons are loaded based on the LINE REFERENCE from the CURRENT TURN and the then selected RESPONSE.

The listener gets to read the CURRENT LINE, based on the RESPONSE from the listener’s CURRENTLY SELECTED RESPONSE




Reader|IPAD:					Listener|IPHONE:
Line ID: 1 (current)			Line ID: 2 (next)
Line Reference: 2				Line Reference: Depends on responseType (ex. positive)

								click rspBtn -> set line reference

New turn:
Reader|IPAD needs to know NEXT line. Gets this from CURRENT LINE + Listener|IPHONE responseControl’s currentResponseType

end reading, server exchange:					

triggered by progress button
send message to server
			|						triggered by message from server
wait for server response			return responseControl.currentResponseType -> lineRef
			|						     |
triggered by message from server 	     |					
nextLine = lineRef 					currentLine = nextLine
start listening ( nextLine )		start reading ( currentLine )
									
									



Listener|IPAD:					Reader|IPHONE:
Line ID: 3 (next)				Line ID: 2 (current)
LineRef: select rsp (neg)		Line Reference: positive -> 3




Reader|IPAD:					Listener|IPHONE:
Line ID: 3 (current)			Line ID: 6 (next)
lineRef: negative -> 6			Line reference: select rsp
